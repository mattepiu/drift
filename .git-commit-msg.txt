feat(parsers): add full tree-sitter support for Java and PHP

Add tree-sitter parser integration for Java and PHP languages,
completing full AST-based parsing support across all major languages.

Java tree-sitter support:
- java-loader.ts: handles loading tree-sitter-java with graceful fallback
- tree-sitter-java-parser.ts: full Java parser with Spring Boot support
- Extracts classes, interfaces, enums, records, methods, annotations
- Full Spring framework annotation support (@Controller, @Service, etc.)

PHP tree-sitter support:
- php-loader.ts: handles loading tree-sitter-php with graceful fallback
- tree-sitter-php-parser.ts: full PHP parser with Laravel support
- Extracts namespaces, classes, interfaces, traits, enums, methods
- PHP 8+ attribute extraction support
- Laravel controller and model pattern detection

Updated packages:
- driftdetect-core: 0.3.0 → 0.4.0 (new parsers + exports)
- driftdetect-mcp: 0.3.0 → 0.4.0 (PHP parser info in drift_parser_info)
- driftdetect: 0.3.1 → 0.4.0 (PHP status in parser command)

Parser status after this change:
- Python: ✓ tree-sitter (full support)
- C#: ✓ tree-sitter (full support)
- Java: ✓ tree-sitter (full support)
- PHP: ✓ tree-sitter (full support)
- TypeScript/JS: ✓ typescript-compiler-api (full support)

BREAKING CHANGE: None - all changes are additive
